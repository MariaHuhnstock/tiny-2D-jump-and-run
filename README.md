# **tiny-2D-jump-and-run**
This Jump & Run game was developed as part of a university assignment using openFrameworks.
The original task from the course involved implementing a series of features step-by-step — from basic gravity and collision detection to full gameplay with collectibles, scoring, and a time limit.

Implemented Features

Physics & Gravity – Player falls naturally with physics-based gravity.

Collision Detection – Checks against platforms, obstacles, and level boundaries.

Solid Ground & Obstacles – Player cannot pass through floors or platforms.

Jump Mechanic – Triggered via W or SPACE, with grounded check.

Collision Feedback – Displays “ouch!” when colliding with a specific in-game object.

Sound Effects – Plays a jump sound effect using ofSoundPlayer.

Custom Player Sprite – Pixel-art PNG replaces the placeholder circle.

Collectible Items – Floating red orbs fall from above for the player to collect.

Score Display – On-screen counter tracks collected orbs.

Orb–Platform Interaction – Orbs vanish when colliding with platforms.

Time Limit – Game ends after a set time and displays final score.
